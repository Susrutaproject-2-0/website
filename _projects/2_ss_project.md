* How many manuscripts of the *Compendium of Suśruta* survive from ancient and pre-modern India?  At the present time, we think that there are over 200 surviving manuscripts that are called “*Suśrutasaṃhitā*” in various library catalogues and listings.  However, most of these are not complete copies of the whole text.  A small proportion, perhaps 20%, are dated.
  A list of the manuscripts of the Suśrutasaṃhitā that have so far been identified can be found [here on PanditProject website](https://panditproject.org/entity/42004/work#manuscripts_manuscripts).

  * Where are these manuscripts found?  They are kept in libraries all over India, as can be seen in this map: [Google map with these locations plotted](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=196xRPRGdywqXq0Tzqjnc_C4DOZEIQ4U&usp=sharing).
