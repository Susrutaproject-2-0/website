* How many manuscripts of the *Compendium of Suśruta* survive from ancient and pre-modern India?  At the present time, we think that there are over 200 surviving manuscripts that are called “*Suśrutasaṃhitā*” in various library catalogues and listings.  However, most of these are not complete copies of the whole text.  A small proportion, perhaps 20%, are dated.
  A list of the manuscripts of the Suśrutasaṃhitā that have so far been identified can be found [on the PanditProject website](https://panditproject.org/entity/42004/work#manuscripts_manuscripts).

* Where are these manuscripts found?  They are kept in libraries all over India, with a few in Europe and one in the USA, as can be seen in this map (yellow=1-5 MSS, green=6-10 MSS, blue=11-15 MSS, red=16+):
